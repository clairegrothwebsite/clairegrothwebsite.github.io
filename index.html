			<p class="WritingBox"> Inside of the United Realms of <strong> Savand </strong> lie seven countries that span from the sea to the deep mountains. Everywhere in between are dozens of creatures: <em> Elves, Dwarves, Dryads, and Dragonborn </em> who live together. The realms of <strong> Otrar, Taradlands, Thiir, Firenshikk, Floura, Sirdaz, and Shonia </strong> are home different species and different ideals. Some cities within have a diverse range of these fantasy races, while others remain cut off from the outside world due to war or choice. </p>

				<p class="WritingBox"> 	Inside of these realms lie heroes who are fighting for their own causes. Some stand up for the Defenseless, Others fight for revenge, and some seek their selfish wants. Each of the heroes form <em> The Seekers of the Goldenlight </em> who fight for the people of Savand. Though they don't know there are others like them, every fight brings them closer to eachother and closer to their final enemy: the truth. </p>

		<p> After being introduced to the D&D community in 2023, it's safe to say that I have been enthralled with this universe. The collaboration and creativity that accompanies this game allows you to create and shape a universe to your liking. I've participated in a handful of campaigns and created characters that have yet to see battle. Somewhere along the way, I decided to create a universe where a future campaign could take place. I grabbed ideas from past games, characters that I grew to love, and new ones that I haven't started their journey. From this idea sprouted a new world,<b> The World of Savand</b>, where my characters interact and their story plays out. It also serves as home to new players as they join my future campaigns in this world that we will explore together. Come with us as I flesh out this world and provide updates as we explore <b> Savand </b> with our Guild. </p>

		<h2> The World of Savand </h2>
		<p> Inside the <b> United Realms of Savand </b> lie seven realms that span from sea to the high mountains. The realms of <b> Otrar, Taradlands, The Kingdom of Thiir, Floura, The Holy Findlaire Empire, Sirdaz, and Shonia </b> each form one of the seven pieces that make <b> Savand </b> powerful. Everywhere in between are dozens of creatures who call this place home: <i>Elves, Dwarves, Dryads, and Dragonborn</i>. Some cities are home to a diverse range of these fantasy races, while others remain cut off from the outside world. While everything seems peaceful to outsiders, a chill runs through the spine of the country as realms and creatures start to turn and emerge from the unknown. </p>

		<h2> The Seekers of the Goldenlight </h2>
		<p> Inside these realms are people who fight for different causes, whether they were searching for it or they stumbled upon injustice. Each of these people are heroes who form <b><i>The Seekers of the Goldenlight</i></b>, a guild that fights for the people of <b>Savand</b>. Though they donâ€™t know there are others like them, every fight and journey will bring them closer. Once together, their final enemy is the truth. </p>

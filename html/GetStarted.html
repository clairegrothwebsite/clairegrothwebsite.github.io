			<h2> Feeling overwhelmed? I'll break it down for you! </h2>
		<hr><br>
				
				<p class="Label"> Struggling on a name? </p>
				
					<p>I suggest starting with a name you like and being open to changing it later as their personality develops. Using name generators is a great starting point! 
						<a href=" https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/dungeons-and-dragons.php"> Here</a>
					is my personal favorite that contains names based on race and heritage. </p>
		<br>
				<p class="Label"> What is a class? </p>
	
					<p> Think of a class as your character’s profession and personality. This determines their abilities and skills which directly leads to how they are played. <i>Reference the bottom of the page to get a feel on each classes goals.</i></p>
		<br>
				<p class="Label"> Choosing a race </p>
				
					<p>Each race has distinct characteristics, abilities, and lore within the D&D universe. This can determine your backstory or how you play the character after finding further information on their D&D heritage. <i>Please reference the bottom of the page to get a brief summary of each race.</i></p>
		<br>
				<p class="Label"> What are character backgrounds? </p>
	
					<p> Every character has a backstory before joining a party of adventurers. What drove them from their home? What made them who they are, and what fuels their goals? Each background grants you different combinations of abilities, proficiencies, and skills. This part is easiest to reference on the official <b><em>D&D Beyond</em></b> website or another page that contains a good summary for each. </p>
		<br>
				<p class="Label"> Character ability scores 
				<br>
				-This is where it gets technical!- </p>
	
					<p> Your stats determine how you play your character and shape their personality in conversation and combat. In other words, it’s how you interact with the world as you play. There are six stats used to create your character: <i>Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.</i> The higher the number for one of your stats, the more proficient you are in that skill, so make sure to use them according to how you want to play your character! What does each of the six stats represent? <i>Reference the bottom of the page for a simplified explanation.</i></p>
		<br>
				<p class="Label"> Creating a Backstory- <p>
	
					<p>Similar to your character's background, you'll dig deeper into what brought them to where they are now, but without receiving any extra bonuses. This is for your reference and your characters lore. Perhaps you have a secret about your past that you don’t want to tell others. Maybe your character has a specific personality. Is family important to them? Do they have a family? <strong>Remember! Most importantly, this is for you! Please be as creative as you’d like and have fun.</strong> </p>

<!--SAVAND INFO-->

	<p> The 7 realms are ruled by <em>Queen Olympia De Rosa</em>, a crown that has been passed down through generations since <em> 59 D.C. </em> starting with Haemus De Rosa. Before the De Rosa's rule of <b> Savand</b>, there were 3 countries that span over current Savand: <b> Avaria, Stiyp, and Thirund</b>. These countries were peaceful until a pillar appeared where the 3 countries boundaries met. This pillar was created of bone with a skull topped upon its cap. It has since been named the <strong><em> Pillar of Athanasia</em></strong>, after the ancient goddess of destruction and judgement who was said to be beheaded in a war of Gods. This pillar was said to influence the mind of mortals and cause the persons hatred and selfish desires to be their only thoughts. The pillar influenced the minds of the leaders, causing their desire for power to be their only thoughts. This included the desire for this pillar to be their own. The leaders fought for days, and thus, the battle for power began. After the ruler of <b> Avaria</b> gained the pillar, he retreated behind their walls. The realms of <b> Stiyp</b> and <b> Thirund</b> began <i><b>The Siege of Avaria</b></i> as the rulers obsessed over the pillar and its secrets. Drafts of civilians were called to battle as they stormed the borders of <b> Avaria</b>. Behind the walls, the pillar's power spread, brainwashing people to carry out its will—seeking only destruction. From within the bone, the power of the goddess emerged, allowing for <b> Avaria</b> to wield the power of destruction and judgement. Outside the walls, units of men, women, and soldiers vaporized as they were judged on their life. This was outlined as the darkest point in <b> Savand's</b> history as friends turned against each other and people vanished at the thought of the pillar. This initial siege lasted for 3 years until a civilian stepped up to free the realms. History outlines an Avarian that withstood the power of the pillar and snuck into the castle where it was held. There he destroyed the power of Athanasia and broke the controlling power that held the lands. War seemed to stop instantly, people wandered, confused about where they were and how they had arrived. This Avarian was named Haemus De Rosa, who then became the king of his birthland. The leaders of <b> Avaria, Stiyp, and Thirund</b> soon each took a piece of the <strong><em> Pillar of Athanasia</em></strong> and hid it among their territories. It took Haemus De Rosa <em> 59 years</em> to rebuild what the pillar and greed destroyed, and only then did the countries rebuild themselves as <b> Savand</b>. They entered the current age of peace and trade amongst new civilizations and open borders for all races and people to live without fear of the Divine Wrath of Athanasia. 
	
<!--OTRAR-->
	<h2> Ortar </h2>
	<p> The only Federation inside of <b> Savand</b> where each city’s land governs themselves separately under the central monarchy of <b> Savand</b>. This realm spans from the <i> Golden Mountains</i> of the South-West to the North-Eastern <i> Star Sea</i>. In between lies flat plains and flower patches that span between the mysterious forests of the realm. Along the coast lies the fishing and trading cities that spread their goods across the realm. These federations used to live peacefully before <b><i> Bastion Keep</i></b> had enough. Now, the Federation of <b><i>Bastion Keep</i></b> threatens to tip the balance and take <b> Otrar</b> by force to make it theirs. The cities remain on edge, but refuse to get involved directly to stop their reach. Inside these cities, they range from extravagant castles made of beautiful stone work such as the <b><i> Ehoral Kingdom </i></b>, while some are quaint constructed from cobblestone and logs like <b><i>Bystead</i></b>. This realm is very diverse in races and magical abilities, however the communities tend to stick together inside of cities and forests. </p>

<!--TARADLANDS-->
	<h2> Taradlands </h2>
	<p> Lead by their <em> Lord Blaine Atwood </em>, <b> Taradlands</b> prides themselves as the military of the people. This selfless country has recently dedicated themselves to preventing the war from spreading outside of <b>Shonia</b>. The cities are highly developed nations with magical colleges and military bases. These are signs of the peaceful stature of <b>Taradlands</b> who is no longer focused on survival and instead values knowledge and personal joy. The realm contains the steep cliffs of <i><b>Engar Summit</b></i> with towns and cities clinging to its edge. Plains span the rest <b>Taradlands</b> with forests spanning the southern edge. 90% of all civilians center themselves in cities that range from a few hundred to thousands, leading to all kinds of races and classes to be in one city. Tieflings, Orcs, Humans, Dwarves, and Half-Elves protect and contribute to the rich culture of these cities. The forests remain wild, undeveloped, and untouched by mortal hands. </p>

<!--KINGDOM OF THIIR-->
	<h2> Kingdom of Thiir </h2>
	<p> Lead by <em> Lady Eleanore Smithe</em>, <b>Thiir</b> is the largest and most extensive realm of <b>Savand</b>. Known as trade central for the realms, it holds the most diverse and extensive cities with all races and professions. This realm is best know for their well developed cities, where all of them are made of stone and contain thousands of citizens. Outside of the cities are mansions and larger villages that show the economic security and prosperity Thiir holds. Along the Eastern edge of Thiir sits the <i><b>Shadhaara desert</b></i>. People dare not to enter as legend says that’s where the great battle that caused the old powers began grappling for power. While <b>Thiir</b> is the economic and trade central that connects all of <b>Savand</b>, they tend to deal with their problems and no one else’s. Their military stands stagnant, patrolling the boarders and cities to ensure order and safety. Inside of all cities are immigrants and people who call themselves citizens of <b>Thiir</b>. High elves, halflings, humans, half elves and other races mingle and live within the borders. </p>

<!--FLOURA-->
	<h2> Floura </h2>
	<p> Floura is a wild country that is lead by the <em> Avington family</em>. Covered 90% with thick forests of pine and oak: <i><b>Styip Hollow, Nanmore Grove, and Lashew Wood</b></i>, wild creatures call this place home. Dryads, Satyrs, Centaurs, Gnomes, Orcs, and Wood Elves roam these enchanted woods. While there is peace in these lands, there is also crime and a lack of organization between villages. Scattered across the forests are quaint villages and towns of wood where citizens make their living through small businesses. These citizens are work driven and often struggle for security as <b> Floura’s</b> trade is limited to wood. There are a handful of well developed cities that disperse any trade and offer jobs to those who need it, however they lack a military and are crime ridden. Not all forests have been explored, and there are stories that outline the dangers of the unknown deep woods. </p>

<!--THE HOLY FINDLAIRE EMPIRE-->
	<h2> The Holy Findlaire Empire </h2>
	<p> Lead by a priest of Helm, <em> Horace Alden</em>, this realm is dedicated to the deities of the Divine Realm. This peaceful country provides a sanctuary for worshipers who wish to spread their religion across the people and realms. The capital city <i><b>Helmfire</b></i> is dedicated to the worship of <b><i>Helm</i></b>, the god of protection, that sits ontop the wintery mountain of <b><i> Pinnacle Peaks</i></b>, surrounded by beautiful valleys and mountain passes that connect the realm to others. Scattered across the land are shrines dedicated to different gods, villages and cities often house a chosen deity to worship and bless their town as they see fit. Welcoming to all races, primarily Elves, Genasi, Dwarves, and  Humans. The large cities have developed themselves from the original shrines of holy cites and made elaborate and beautiful cities to reflect the gods ideals and personification. Inside of cities, citizen mingle and futures and religions merge. While not everyone is accepting, there is little to no violent outbreaks within this realm.</p>

<!--SIRDAZ-->
	<h2> Sirdaz </h2>
	<p> Voted by the people, <em>Sir Roman Farraday</em> watches over the land from the only city in the land, <i><b>Silvergal</b></i>. Inside its walls lies the trading port of the realm. Trading stands, Merchants, and adventurers all flood into this port to reach the shores of <b>Savand</b>. The main purpose of this city is to provide payment to citizens for the traded goods that is dispersed across <b>Savand</b> and beyond. Outside of the city lies villages surrounded by fields of different agriculture. <b>Sirdaz</b> is the main provider of agricultural needs across the realms and citizens spend their lives working the fields. Humans, Gnomes, Goliaths, and halflings call these places home. Citizens all work together, ensuring that their fields provide a hearty harvest and are protected from any raiders. These fertile lands cover 90% of the realm while the <b><i> Enchanted Tips</i></b> cover the North-East with sporadic forests in between. This country is peaceful between farmers, neighbors, and citizens, but raiders often scavenge fields for their goods and to take the profit for themselves. Fires and destruction has began to spread as these raiders gain a name for themselves. </p>

<!--SHONIA-->
	<h2> Shonia </h2>
	<p> Overthrown by Drow leader <em> Haelra Tuin </em>, this realm has been ridden with war as the Drow search for a long lost artifact that was dug from the <b><i>Underdark</i></b> beneath <b> Shonia</b>. Surrounded by the <b><i>Towering Tips, Celest Range, and Bahamut Peak</i></b> on all sides except the west where a river flows into the realm.  100 meters under the surface the <b><i>Underdark</i></b> spans far and wide housing unknown horros and creatures. Uncovered by Dwarves digging for precious gems and materials for their elaborate cities, the Drow's artifact was dragged from its home. Before being taken over, <b>Shonia</b> was home to the Dragonborns and Dwarves. These races worked together to create elaborate stonework palaces, cities, and architecture only to have it lay in rubble from the destruction of the Drow. These cities have been taken over with crude remakes of sacred buildings created by the enslaved Dragonborn civilians. The war has left the population scattered and ensalved until the Drow take back what was rightfully theirs. They will go to any length to take back what they desire most, including taking over all of <b>Savand</b>. </p>

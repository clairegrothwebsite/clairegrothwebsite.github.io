<!--LIZ-->
	<p> <b>Liz Valdivian <i>| Half-Elf | Wizard</i></b> </p>
		<ul>
			<li> A Sage whose family owns one of the oldest Elven libraries in the country of <b>Floura</b>. This library has been in the family for generations of Wood Elves on her mother's side. It's nestled deep in the woods and holds many ancient scripts from all cultures. </li>
			<li> Her mother is a <em>Wood Elf librarian</em>, while her father is a <em>Human</em> carpenter. </li>
			<li> She has worked and lived in the family library all her life, gathering new texts and learning from the shelves. At the age of 18, she finally left the library in search of new texts to add to her family's collection. </li>
			<li> At her departure, her father gave her a wooden cabinet to carry these texts. It is worn like a large backpack, almost as tall as Liz herself. </li>

<!--ONYX-->
	<p> <b> Onyx <i>| Kenku | Ranger</i></b> </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Outlander to his hometown in <b>Floura</b>. He was taken in by an old hermit when the town cast him out. He was taught how to live in the deep forests that borders his old home and how to communicate with others. </li>
			<li> <em>Kenku's</em> are large, raven-like, birds that aren't able to talk on their own accord. <em>Kenku</em> can never produce their own sounds. Their voices were taken by a deity long ago, forcing them to mimic others' words instead. </li>
			<li> After the old hermit passed, Onyx wielded two sickles and uses his keen knowledge of the land to keep undead monsters at bay. He has made it his mission to protect his old town from the dark that lingers in the forest. His main enemy: his hunger for revenge. </li>
		</ul>

			<li> Irnek is originally from a small village in <b>Shonia</b>, a barren country home to few kingdoms. War has since destroyed his home and family, leaving him nothing left in <b> Shonia</b>, and few are left to defy the <em>Drows</em>. </li>
